#Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

The following repository shows the way I onboarded the project I choose in order to get Google's Professional Certificate:**Cyclistic**. The data analyzed was made available by Motivate International under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

A final report to stakeholders was written and published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ricardo020796/google-data-analytics-capstone-project-cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-ba2df0681689), where the conclusions of the study where shown. In this repository, I intend to further explain the analysis process I developed as to arrive to my final conclusions.
