# Scenario :scream:	

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in the city of Chicago (Illinois). For the sake of the company's survival, the marketing director wants to better understand how casual riders (those who pay full days or single passes) behave compared to members (this last group pays for a membership) in order to promote campaigns where the conversion towards "member" is a must for the company, as this group has been highlighted as the most profitable.

## Ask :question:

As a data analyst assigned to this task, the main problem I am trying to solve is to better **understand** how each group behaves and **indentify** patterns to propose creative data-drive decisions to increase the current number users paying for a membership. The principal stakeholder in this project is the Director of Marketing, as I will report directly to her and, besides, she is the one who will point out the route the company will take depending on the insights of my analysis. Besides this, it is important to note that the conclusions of my report will be based completely on the data recolected by the company, so it should clearly content positive business decisions that are hidden among millions of rows f data.
